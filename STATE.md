# STATE

Machine-readable-ish snapshot of where this design system is right now. Read
this file FIRST — before ARCHITECTURE.md, before the decisions/ log, before
touching any code. It exists so an agent picking up this repo cold doesn't
have to reconstruct history to find out what's already decided.

If you make a change that invalidates a line below, update that line in the
same commit. This file drifting out of sync with reality is the single
fastest way this repo becomes unmaintainable for the next agent.

```yaml
repo_version: 1.2.2
last_updated: 2026-08-31
status: All three packages are LIVE on the public npm registry. T026
        (create the tfrc npm org, add NPM_TOKEN, tag, publish) is done —
        v1.2.0 published foundation/marketing/product at 1.0.0 on
        2026-08-30. That tag was cut before a documentation/coverage
        correction pass landed, so 1.0.0's published description of
        @tfrc/product is permanently wrong (npm won't let you edit
        published metadata). The 1.2.1 patch release that should have
        fixed this only got foundation and marketing to 1.0.1 —
        @tfrc/product's own "Publishing access" setting on npmjs.com
        rejected the automation token, and every retry re-ran the whole
        job from its first step, re-failing on foundation's now-live
        version before ever reaching product again. 1.2.2 fixes
        publish.yml itself (skip-if-already-published, per step) so the
        job survives a partial-failure retry; it carries no package
        version bump. Confirm @tfrc/product actually reached 1.0.1 on the
        registry before trusting the packages table below. See
        decisions/0008.md, 0009.md, and
        specs/002-product-consumption-contract/tasks.md T025–T028.

themes_shipped_on_product_layer:

open_risks:                      # unverified assumptions that would need a
                                 # decision reversed, not a patch, if wrong.
  - tfrc-verify's raw-value detection is heuristic and will produce some
    false positives. The tfrc-allow-raw escape hatch exists for those, and
    every use of it is printed and counted so erosion stays visible.

resolved_risks:
  - the "@tfrc" npm scope is real, owned by the company, and all three
    packages are published on it. The npm org `tfrc` was created, an
    `NPM_TOKEN` with publish rights was added, and `v1.2.0` was tagged and
    published successfully on 2026-08-30 — specs/002 T026 is done. (Earlier
    entries here said the scope would be "claimed automatically by
    whichever account first publishes to it" — that was wrong for a scope
    this specific; a scope is granted only by registering a user or org of
    that exact name. Corrected in specs/002 tasks.md T025.)

known_gaps_for_v1.3:             # intentionally out of scope, not
                                 # forgotten. Don't silently re-decide these —
                                 # open an ADR first if you're tackling one.
  - publishing authenticates with a long-lived NPM_TOKEN, not trusted
    publishing (OIDC). Deliberate bootstrap ordering, not an oversight —
    OIDC can only be configured on a package that already exists, and now
    does (T026 done). Migrate per specs/002 tasks.md T028.
  - packages are published (T026 done, 2026-08-30) but FR-001 is still
    unproven in the sense that matters: no real consumer has installed a
    real package yet (see CONSUMERS.md, still "none yet"). T027 tracks
    this specifically.
  - no icon set yet (foundation/src/icons/ does not exist)
  - apps/docs is a stub; live prototypes exist only as chat deliverables,
    not wired to consume the packages in this repo
  - no build tooling wired (no actual `pnpm install` has been run — this
    repo has never left this container with node_modules present)
  - no visual regression / contrast CI check, only static grep-based lint
  - no real estate theme yet (packages/product/src/themes/estate.css does
    not exist)
  - NO PATH FOR A NATIVE CLIENT. @tfrc/product ships CSS; a native runtime
    can't consume it. Deliberately unsolved — the runtime is unchosen and
    the product doesn't exist. Needs its own spec, and an ADR amending
    Article VIII if it needs a platform-neutral token source. See
    decisions/0007.md's Alternatives before "just adding a JSON export".
  - the actual `specify` CLI has never been run against this repo (no
    network access when it was built) — .specify/ was hand-authored to
    match documented conventions; see .specify/README.md before running
    the real CLI, especially regarding memory/constitution.md
  - SC-001 of specs/002 is asserted, not measured: nobody unfamiliar with
    this repo has yet built a page from CONSUMING.md alone
```
